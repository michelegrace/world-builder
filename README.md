# World Building Project

Just a fun project to build an interactive map-maker for my D&D group!

## What's got to happen

✔️ Choose die (D20 for settlements, D6 for events, D4 for history)
✔️ Toss "Beans" to allow randomize continent(s) configuration
✔️ Clear beans off canvas

- Allow users to draw/edit map features
  - Line for the continent
  - Brush for the sea edges (?) - Stretch
  - Forest brush
  - Mountain Brush
  - Settlements Brush
  - Bodies of Water Brush (line with blue fill?) or Blue line
  - allow clear last line
  - allow erase
- Allow users to select a settlement/event/history die placement and edit appearance and name
- Name Continent
- Save Map
- Integrate SOCKET.IO or something similar for real-time interactivity
